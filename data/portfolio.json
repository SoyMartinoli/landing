With a degree in Financial Management from TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey and a portfolio of hands-on experience across valuation, risk analysis, investment modeling, and real estate development, I specialize in turning complex financial data into actionable insight.\n\nOver the past few years, I have built a dynamic career path through diverse roles: managing private equity valuation cases at Finver Capital, performing portfolio optimization and macroeconomic stress testing at BBVA, and leading development and investment strategies as Co-Founder of Grupo Arze, my real estate investment firm. My approach is structured yet adaptive, and always centered on evidence-based decision-making.\n\nMy technical toolkit includes advanced Excel modeling (macros, Power Query, Solver), Python (pandas, numpy), R, SQL, Power BI, and Bloomberg Terminal. I apply these tools to projects involving discounted cash flow (DCF) modeling, scenario analysis, CAPM-based cost of capital estimation, private asset valuation, and due diligence for both financial and operational planning.\n\nI thrive in environments where strategic finance meets real-world complexity. Whether I am assessing risk exposure in manufacturing operations, evaluating investment opportunities in underserved markets, or designing business plans with cross-functional stakeholders, I bring both a big-picture mindset and an obsessive attention to detail.\n\nBeyond technical skill, I value clear communication, structured problem-solving, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Whether I am working alongside engineers, legal teams, investors, or fellow analysts, I aim to create clarity, alignment, and measurable impact.\n\nI am deeply interested in global capital markets, infrastructure, and financial innovation. I see financial modeling not as a theoretical exercise but as a practical language for solving real problems: unlocking capital, empowering teams, and building trust.\n\nCurrently, I am exploring new challenges where I can apply my analytical background in valuation, strategy, and capital allocation, especially in sectors like energy, infrastructure, real estate, and financial services. I am also expanding my expertise in automation, data science, and financial technology to stay at the forefront of the industry.\n\nLetâ€™s build something that lasts with integrity, insight, and impact.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
